## About Me

I am a 5th year Ph.D candidate in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.wustl.edu/index.html) at the Washington University in St. Louis. I am a part of both the [Institute for Informatics, Data Science & Biostatistics](https://i2db.wustl.edu/) advised by [Dr Philip Payne](https://i2db.wustl.edu/people/philip-payne/) and the [MINDS lab](https://www.mir.wustl.edu/research/research-centers/computational-imaging-research-center-circ/labs/sotiras-lab/) lab advised by [Dr Aristeidis Sotiras](https://asotiras.com/). 

My research interests broadly lie at the intersection of machine learning and healthcare with applications to medical imaging and Electronic Health Records (EHR) data. Specifically, my dissertation research focuses on investigating novel deep learning methods that can learn intermediate data-driven representations from multimodal healthcare data for interpreting model decisions for patient-specific clinical outcomes. I am passionate about bridging the gap between deep learning models and clinicians in terms of trust, fairness and deploying models in healthcare.

Before joining WashU, I completed my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering from [Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/) and my Masters in Technology (M.Tech) from [Indian Statistical Institute](https://www.isical.ac.in/) under the supervision of [Dr Swagatam Das](https://www.isical.ac.in/~swagatam.das/). My master's dissertation research was on the topic ["On the Choice of Appropriate Combination of Classifier and Decomposition Scheme for Multiclass Imbalanced Data Classification : A Comparative Analysis"](http://library.isical.ac.in:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10263/7259/Dissertation_final.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y). 

<!--During my M.Tech, I visited the [SOS lab](https://www.bcs.tu-darmstadt.de/welcome/index.en.jsp) of TU Darmstadt for a summer internship where I worked on "Modeling communication in social networks by approximating Markov Chains" under the supervision of [Dr Heinz Koppl]() and [Dr Wasiur R. KhudaBukhsh](https://www.wasiur.xyz/).--> 

I will be joining the Computational Health Research Branch at National Library of Medicine (NLM) at National Institures on Health as a Intramural Post-doctoral Visiting Fellow. I will be working with [Dr Jeremy Weiss](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/researchstaff/WeissJeremy.html). For more details about me and my research, please check out my [CV](https://sayantankumar.github.io/files/Resume_latest.pdf).
